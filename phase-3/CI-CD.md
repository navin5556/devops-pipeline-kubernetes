4. **SonarQube Scanner**:
   - SonarQube is a code quality and security analysis tool.
   - SonarQube is tool that analyzes the code and generate the report that report is pulished to sonarQube server.
   - This plugin integrates Jenkins with SonarQube by providing a scanner that analyzes code during builds.
   - You can install it from the Jenkins plugin manager as described above.

5. **Kubernetes CLI**:
   - This plugin allows Jenkins to interact with Kubernetes clusters using the Kubernetes command-line tool (`kubectl`).
   - It's useful for tasks like deploying applications to Kubernetes from Jenkins jobs.
   - Install it through the plugin manager.

6. **Kubernetes**:

   - It provides dynamic scaling and resource optimization capabilities for Jenkins builds.
   - Install it from the Jenkins plugin manager.

7. **Docker**:
   - This plugin allows Jenkins to interact with Docker, enabling Docker builds and integration with Docker registries.
   - You can use it to build Docker images, run Docker containers, and push/pull images from Docker registries.
   - Install it from the plugin manager.

8. **Docker Pipeline**:
   - This plugin extends Jenkins Pipeline with steps to build, publish, and run Docker containers as part of your Pipeline scripts.
   - It provides a convenient way to manage Docker containers directly from Jenkins Pipelines.
   - Install it through the plugin manager like the others.
9. **Maven Integration**:
   - this plugin keeps your projects in sync and ensures they are always tested with the latest updates, saving you time and effort.
   

After installing these plugins, you may need to configure them according to your specific environment and requirements. This typically involves setting up credentials, configuring paths, and specifying options in Jenkins global configuration or individual job configurations. Each plugin usually comes with its own set of documentation to guide you through the configuration process.

## Configure Above Plugins in Jenkins as per video

Note: there is no any plugin available for trivy so we are installing it on jenkins server and adding our jenkins pipeline stage.
```
---Trivy installation command----
#reference link - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.18.3/installation/

sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release -y
wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install trivy -y

----------to verify----
ubuntu@ip-172-31-23-167:~$ trivy -v
Version: 0.53.0
```

we have to configure SonarQube server also for that we first add credentials in global credentials using secret text that we get from sonarqube server.
